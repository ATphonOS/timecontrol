# timecontrol Library

## Overview

The library provides ***non-blocking timing control for multitasking use***, except for the `wait()` function, which is a specific and optional utility. Its design based on time comparisons (millis() and micros()) ensures that timing operations are fast and do not interfere with other tasks, making it ideal for applications where continuous flow is critical.

## Installation

1. [Download](https://github.com/ATphonOS/timecontrol/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository.
2. **Install**: Add the library to the Arduino IDE via the ZIP file.
   - Open the Arduino IDE.  
   - Go to `Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...`.  
   - Navigate to the location where you saved `timecontrol-main.zip`, select it, and click "Open".  
   - The IDE will install the library automatically into your `libraries` directory.
3. **Include**: Add the library to your sketch with `#include "timecontrol.h"` or  `#include <timecontrol.h>`.
4. **Verify**:  Restart the Arduino IDE if it was open during installation to ensure the library is recognized.  
   - After restarting, you can confirm the library is available under `Sketch > Include Library`, where "timecontrol" should appear in the list.


## Requirements

- **Software**: Arduino IDE (version 1.8.x or later) or any compatible development environment.

Inlining is beneficial for frequent calls in time-critical loops, reducing execution time at the cost of slightly larger binary size. These functions are defined in the header file (`timecontrol.h`) to allow the compiler to inline them at compile time.

## Usage Notes

- **Precision**: Relies on Arduinoâ€™s `millis()` and `micros()`, which may drift over long periods or reset after ~49 days (millis) or ~70 minutes (micros).
- **Interrupts**: `attachInterrupt()` and `pauseAll()` currently support only one instance due to the static `_instance` design.
- **Buffer Size**: For `formatElapsedTime()`, provide a buffer of at least 9 bytes (`"HH:MM:SS\0"`) to avoid truncation.
- **Thread Safety**: Not designed for multi-threaded environments; use with caution in interrupt-heavy applications.

## Limitations

- **Single Instance Interrupt**: Only one `timecontrol` object can handle interrupts due to the static `_instance` pointer.
- **No Overflow Handling**: Does not explicitly handle `millis()` or `micros()` overflow, though Arduinoâ€™s subtraction method mitigates this for differences.
- **Static Buffer**: `secToTime()` and related functions use a shared static buffer, which may overwrite data in concurrent calls.
